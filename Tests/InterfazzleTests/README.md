This module contains unit tests for Interfazzle's core components using Swift Testing framework. Tests verify `PackageValidator` correctly validates Package.swift existence, `Config` properly initializes with default and custom values, `DeclarationFormatter` formats Swift declarations and handles public modifier injection without duplication, and `SymbolSorter` correctly processes empty symbol arrays. The tests focus on verifying the basic contracts of each component without requiring extensive mocking of complex symbol graph structures, ensuring the library's public API behaves as documented.
