InterfazzleTests provides unit tests for the Interfazzle library using Swift Testing framework. The tests verify core functionality including PackageValidator's ability to detect Package.swift presence, Config initialization with default and custom values, DeclarationFormatter's Swift declaration formatting and public modifier handling, and SymbolSorter's basic operations. Tests are organized using nested `@Suite` structs to group related functionality and focus on verifying public API contracts without requiring extensive mocking of complex symbol graph structures.
