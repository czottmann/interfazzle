This module contains the SwiftCLI command implementations that form the user-facing interface of Interfazzle. `GenerateCommand` provides the main workflow combining symbol graph building and documentation generation with options for filtering, verbosity, and lenient error handling. `BuildCommand` offers a standalone operation for generating symbol graphs without creating documentation, useful for debugging or preparing graphs for later processing. `ValidateCommand` performs a simple Package.swift existence check to verify the current directory is a valid Swift package before attempting other operations. Each command uses SwiftCLI's property wrapper syntax for declarative argument parsing and automatic help generation.
