InterfazzleCLI is the command-line interface executable for Interfazzle, built using the SwiftCLI framework. It provides three main commands: `generate` for the full documentation workflow (building symbol graphs and generating Markdown), `build` for creating symbol graphs without documentation, and `validate` for checking Package.swift existence. The CLI uses declarative SwiftCLI property wrappers for argument parsing, supports flags like `--verbose`, `--generate-only`, `--be-lenient`, and `--include-reexported`, and provides automatic help generation with clear error messages and appropriate exit codes.
