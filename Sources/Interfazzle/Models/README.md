This module contains the core data structures used throughout Interfazzle. The `Config` struct encapsulates all command-line options and settings, `SymbolGraph` provides comprehensive Codable types for parsing Swift compiler symbol graph JSON files (including symbols, relationships, and metadata), and `PackageDescription` represents the structure returned by `swift package describe` for extracting target information. These models form the foundation for all symbol graph processing and documentation generation operations.
