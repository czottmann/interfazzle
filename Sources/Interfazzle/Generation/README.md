This module transforms Swift symbol graphs into human-readable Markdown documentation. `DocumentationGenerator` orchestrates the entire generation process by reading symbol graph files, filtering to relevant modules, and coordinating the conversion to Markdown. `SymbolSorter` implements sophisticated algorithms for organizing symbols by dependency relationships and type hierarchy to ensure logical presentation order. `DeclarationFormatter` converts symbol graph declaration fragments into readable Swift syntax strings, handling type name extraction and demangling. `MarkdownFormatter` manages the final output formatting, generating interface-style code blocks with documentation comments and integrating README content with intelligently adjusted heading levels.
