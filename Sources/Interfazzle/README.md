Interfazzle is a library for generating Markdown documentation from Swift symbol graphs. It handles the complete pipeline from validating Swift packages and building symbol graphs through the compiler, to parsing the resulting JSON files, organizing symbols by type hierarchy and dependencies, formatting Swift declarations, and generating clean interface-style Markdown documentation with optional README integration. The library is organized into Models (data structures for Config, SymbolGraph, and PackageDescription), Core (workflow components for validation, building, and extraction), and Generation (documentation formatting and output).
